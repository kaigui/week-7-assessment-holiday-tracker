Holidays are primarily organized as a dictionary of lists of holiday objects. An example may better showcase how the information is structured: **{'2021' : [Holidays], '2022': [Holidays]...}**

The advantage of such a system is that when searching or viewing a specific time period, only the Holidays within the desired year will be searched, improving speed. This primary dictionary is generated from a list of all holidays in dictionary format, which is loaded from a JSON file. Any changes to the "primary dictionary" are also made to the "list of holiday dictionaries", which allows the user to easily save changes to JSON.

#### Add a Holiday
User enters a holiday name (any string) and a date in the format: "YYYY-MM-DD". The date must be valid as defined as the Python "Date" object, otherwise the user will be prompted again for a valid date. Appropriate Holiday objects are created and added to the "primary dictionary". If the new holiday has a year that does not currently exist in the "primary dictionary", a new key in the "primary dicitonary" will be created.

#### Remove a Holiday
User enters a holiday name to remove. If found, Holiday objects with matching names will be removed from all years of the "primary dicitonary", and a decorator function prints a success message. If unsuccessful, the decorator function prints that the desired Holiday was not found in the "primary dictionary". 

#### Save Holiday List
User saves the updated holiday list to holidayList.JSON

#### View Holiday List
User provides a year and week to view matching holidays in the system. The year and week must be valid (Year: 1-9999, Week: 1-53). A Lambda function evaluates if Holiday objects match the desired time frame, and matching Holidays have details presnted to the user. If the selected time frame includes holidays in the next 7 days, the user can request to view simple weather information as well. 

Weather is handled by the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api), and fetches weather information from the 7 day forecast for Minneapolis, MN. Location can set by updating the latitude and longitude variables within the getWeather() function. Weather information is stored as a dictionary: {'date': 'weather', ...} and appended to a printed Holiday, if the dates match.

## holidays.json
The given JSON file to include in the Holiday Tracker system. This file is not used by holidayTracker.ipynb. Instead, this file is loaded into a seperate file, webScrape.ipynb, in order to produce a single combined "holidayList.json" file that the main Holiday Tracker system interacts with. 

## webScrape.ipynb
This file uses BeautifulSoup 4 to scrape https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ for holidays in years 2021-2030. Other years can be easily included by simply modifying the initial for loop that generated urls to scrape. These results are also combined with the given holiday.json file in order to produce a combined "holidayList.json" file that is loaded into holidayTracker.ipynb. As long as "holidayList.json" exists, there is no need to run this file before running the main Holiday Tracker system.
